        "2. The predicted value represents a probabilty and not an exact value. Neural networks deal with probabilities, so given the data that we fed the NN with, it calculated that there is a very high probability that the relationship between X and Y is Y=2X-1, but with only 6 data points we can't know for sure. As a result, the result for 10 is very close to 19, but not necessarily 19."
